    A python 3.6 Battleship game with no UI, just console

    Written on Atom and PyCharm, following PEP8 standards

    Inspired on Codecademy's Python 2 'List and Function - Battleship!'
    www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python/lessons/battleship/

    This project was done with the sole purpose of learning

    Dependencies
        Colorama (pypi.org/project/colorama)

    Features
         8 players (humans or not),
         Salvo (variable number of shots),
         Smart guessing for machine players,
         Variable board sizes for each coordinate,
         Multiples ships with different sizes,
         Decoys (does not count to the number of ships),
         Score tracking,
         Options to change settings about all this features
